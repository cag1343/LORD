**L****o**ng **R**ead sequencing estimation of promoter **D**ominance
-------


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation 

```install.packages("devtools")```
```devtools::install_github("cag1343/LORD", build = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
